# To Do List

## Description

* Created a front end experience that allows a user to create a Task that will display as a sticky-note posted on a cork-board.
* When the Task is created, it is stored on a database and appended to the DOM.
* Each Task has the general task objective, the date it is due by, an opton to mark it complete and an option to delete it.
* When a Task is marked complete the database will be updated with this status and a line-through styling will be applied to the sticky-note to visually represent that the task was completed.
* When the delete button is pressed there will be a pop-up message which will ask the user to confirm their choice to delete. Selecting 'yes' will delete the task from the database and refresh the DOM. selecting 'no' will leave the task alone.
